# run-devops-course

Trying to follow this [Deploying .Net Microservices with K8s, AKS and Azure DevOps](https://www.udemy.com/course/deploying-net-microservices-with-k8s-aks-and-azure-devops/) course.

## Notes
- For the part of automatic builds with docker hubs, since this features turned to be now in the payed membership, I used this approach described in this article [Generando y publicando im√°genes Docker con GitHub Actions](https://www.fixedbuffer.com/publicando-imagenes-docker-con-github-actions/) from [@JorTurFer](https://github.com/JorTurFer)
